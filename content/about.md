# $ whoami

I'm an **Infrastructure Engineer** at **[OVH](https://www.ovh.com)**.

I have a passion for **distributed systems** problems, specifically when it comes with **scalability and performance issues**.


# Work

#### Now

I am working on a new kind of product within OVH, codenamed `IO`. Stay tuned!

#### 2016 to 2019

I worked on **[Metrics Data Platform](https://www.ovh.com/fr/data-platforms/metrics/)**. We are using **[Warp10](http://www.warp10.io/)** with friendly Apache softwares such as **Hbase, Hadoop, Zookeeper, Kafka and Flink** to handle all OVH's metrics-based monitoring, which represent around **432 billions of measurements per day**.

I have taken part of most of Metrics development, from internal management to Ingress/Egress translation part. I also worked on the implementation and deployement of a distributed and scalable alerting system using Apache Flink.

I was using `Flink`, `HBase`, `Hadoop,` `Kafka`, `Ansible`, `Go`, `Rust`, `Java`, `Linux`, `WarpScript` on a daily basis.

I was **on-call duty** on more than 700 servers, including:

* 3 Warp10 fully distributed clusters, including one that handling 1.5 millions datapoints per second
* 3 Hadoop clusters, including a 240 nodes Hadoop cluster running a 75k regions Hbase table
* Various Apache technologies, such as Kafka, Zookeeper and Flink

I gave training and support for both external and internal client of Metrics, including WarpScript.

# Outside work

On the other side, I'm giving a hand to local events, such as the GDG/JUG **[FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/)**, **[Devoxx4Kids](https://twitter.com/devoxx4kidsbes)** and **[DevFest du Bout du Monde](https://devfest.duboutdumonde.bzh/)**, a technical conference. 

I cofounded in 2017 **[HelloExoWorld](https://helloexo.world/)**, a association to search for exoplanets using Warp10. 

I'm also a teaching assistant in my former Engineer School, and sometimes I'm giving **[talks](/talks)** and **[writing stuff online](/posts)**.
