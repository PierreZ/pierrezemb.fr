## $ whoami

I'm an **Infrastructure Engineer** at **[OVH](https://www.ovh.com)**.

I have a passion for **distributed systems** problems, specifically when it comes with **scalability and performance issues**.

I'm the **deep-dive's** type of guy, i.e. I'm not scared of having to **optimize components** like the JVM or the Linux Kernel to reach my goal, or **read** Hbase basecode to understand how it internally works.

I'm developing software using **Go, Rust and Java**, as well as performing **on-call duty** on more than 500 servers, including several Hadoop clusters.

## Work

I'm currently working on **[Metrics Data Platform](https://www.ovh.com/fr/data-platforms/metrics/)**. We are using **[Warp10](http://www.warp10.io/)** with friendly Apache softwares such as **Hbase, Hadoop, Zookeeper, Kafka and Flink** to handle all OVH's metrics-based monitoring, which represent around **432 billions of measurements per day**.

## Outside work

On the other side, I'm giving a hand to local events, such as the GDG/JUG **[FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/)**, **[Devoxx4Kids](https://twitter.com/devoxx4kidsbes)** and **[DevFest du Bout du Monde](https://devfest.duboutdumonde.bzh/)**, a technical conference. 

I cofounded in 2017 **[HelloExoWorld](https://helloexo.world/)**, a association to search for exoplanets using Warp10. 

I'm also a teaching assistant in my former Engineer School, and sometimes I'm giving **[talks](/talks)** and **[writing stuff online](/posts)**.
