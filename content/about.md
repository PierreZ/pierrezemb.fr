I am an **Tech Lead** at **[OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com)**. I love working with **distributed systems**, specifically around **data storage**.

I enjoy being part of open-source communities, with **[talks](/talks)**, **[blogposts](/posts)**, and contributions to:

* [Warp10](https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/commits?author=PierreZ)
* Apache
    * [HBase](https://github.com/apache/hbase/commits/master?author=PierreZ)
    * [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink/commits/master?author=PierreZ)
    * [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commits/master?author=PierreZ)
* and [others](https://github.com/PierreZ/).

On my free time, I am giving a hand to local events, such as the local GDG/JUG **[FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/)**, **[Devoxx4Kids](https://twitter.com/devoxx4kidsbes)** and **[DevFest du Bout du Monde](https://devfest.duboutdumonde.bzh/)**, a technical conference. I am also a **teaching assistant** in my former Engineer School.

I cofounded in 2017 **[HelloExoWorld](https://helloexo.world/)**, a initiative to search for exoplanets using Warp10, a time-series platform.

# Work

#### 2019 to now: Tech Lead @OVHcloud

I am working on the underlying infrastructure of `IO` oriented products, including [ioStream](https://labs.ovh.com/iostream), a geo-replicated, managed topic-as-a-service product built using [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org) currently in beta.

#### 2016 to 2019: Infrastructure Engineer @OVH

I worked on **[Metrics Data Platform](https://www.ovh.com/fr/data-platforms/metrics/)**. We are using **[Warp10](http://www.warp10.io/)** with friendly Apache softwares such as **Hbase, Hadoop, Zookeeper, Kafka and Flink** to handle all OVH's metrics-based monitoring, which represent around **432 billions of measurements per day**.

I have taken part of most of Metrics development, from internal management to Ingress/Egress translation part. I also worked on the implementation and deployement of a distributed and scalable alerting system using Apache Flink.

I was using `Flink`, `HBase`, `Hadoop,` `Kafka`, `Ansible`, `Go`, `Rust`, `Java`, `Linux`, `WarpScript` on a daily basis.

I was **on-call duty** on more than 700 servers, including:

* 3 Warp10 fully distributed clusters, including one that handling 1.5 millions datapoints per second
* 3 Hadoop clusters, including a 250 nodes Hadoop cluster running a 75k regions Hbase table
* Various Apache technologies, such as Kafka, Zookeeper and Flink

I gave training and support for both external and internal client of Metrics, including WarpScript.
