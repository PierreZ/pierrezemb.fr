# Abstract

OVHcloud is the biggest European cloud provider. From dedicated servers to Managed Kubernetes, from VMwareÂ® based Hosted Private Cloud to OpenStack-based Public Cloud, we have over 1.4 million customers worldwide.

Internally, we have been running Apache Kafka for years, and despite all the skills obtained operating multiples clusters with millions of messages per second, we decided to shift and build the foundation of our 'topic-as-a-service' product called ioStream on Apache Pulsar.
In this talk, you will have the insights of why we decided to use Apache Pulsar instead of Apache Kafka as the core of ioStream. We will tell you our journey to use Apache Pulsar, from our deployments to the management, what did work and what did not.
