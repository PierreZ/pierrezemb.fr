This Top-Level Apache project is defined as « A scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service optimized for real-time workloads ». BookKeeper is suitable for a wide variety of use cases, from WAL to storage. In this talk, we will dive into Bookkeeper’s concepts, the public API, deployments and how it is used within Pulsar.
