# Abstract


The FoundationDB Record Layer is an open source library that provides a record-oriented datastore with semantic similar to a relational database, implemented on top of FoundationDB. It is highly used within Apple by CloudKit, Appleâ€™s cloud backend service to host billions of independent databases, many with a common schema.

In this talk, we will dig into the paper and the library's concepts and feature. You will also discover how to use the library from a developer's point-of-view, with examples taken from ETCD-Layer and Record-Store.
