## 👋 Hi, I'm Pierre Zemb

I’m a Software Engineer building data infrastructure at [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/). I’ve built and operated a variety of stateful distributed systems throughout my career.

I’m interested in distributed systems, data stores, understanding how things works under the hood. I enjoy being part of open-source communities.
